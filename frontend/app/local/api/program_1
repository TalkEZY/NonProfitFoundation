    <h1>Listen Carefully</h1>

<p>Research shows that 1 in 8 children and teens in the United States has hearing loss, largely due to high-volume sounds in daily life. Most hearing loss among teens can be avoided if simple protective measures&ndash;such as lowering the volume&ndash;are taken.</p>

<p>The program combines music and education to raise awareness about the fragility of hearing and the dangers of exposure to high decibel sounds.&nbsp;This year Starkey Hearing Foundation expanded Listen Carefully to offer educational support to more than 16,000 teachers and nearly 500,000 students nationwide.</p>

<h1>Make a Difference&nbsp;</h1>

<p>Start with yourself. Your family. Your friends. Because you understand the transformative, interconnecting power of hearing. 1 in 5 Americans has hearing loss-meaning we&rsquo;re losing our hearing faster, today, than our parents or grandparents did.</p>

<h1>Educate Yourself&nbsp;</h1>

<p>Loud sounds are often part of daily life. Repeat or elongated exposure to high-volume sounds&ndash;such as music pumped through headphones&ndash;harms hearing over time.</p>

<p>Your ears are complex organs, but protecting them is relatively simple. Use these resources to increase your awareness. And share what you know.</p>
