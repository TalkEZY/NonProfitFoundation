    "text": "<p>Starkey Hearing Foundation&nbsp;is excited to be heading back to the West Bank soon for an upcoming hearing mission. Our work in the region has shown us how hearing brings people together and serves as a vehicle for peace and understanding.</p>  <p>We wanted to share some feedback from a recent mission as we currently prepare for the next one.</p>  <p>&ldquo;Before the mission &ndash; my first &ndash; I was so excited and really didn&rsquo;t know what to expect. Now I can definitely&nbsp;say it was not like anything I had done before. I have lived in this conflict all my life, and today, for the first time I met my neighbors who greeted me with nothing but love. I was amazed to see all the happy faces and know that my small efforts could give someone so much joy. I hope that this mission will take us one step closer to peace, and I hope it won&rsquo;t be the last.&rdquo;</p>  <p>- Chen Cohen</p>  <p>Our local partners have been hard at work, completing phase one by identifying patients and taking impressions. We look forward to contributing to peace building by continuing to foster connections between people and across cultures through the gift of hearing. Check out the photos below to see the preparation.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.ahundredyears.com/uploads/westbank2.jpeg\" style=\"height:250px; width:333px\" />&nbsp;</p>",
