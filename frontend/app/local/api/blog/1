      "text": "<p>Dave Fabry, Ph.D. audiologist and Starkey Hearing Technologies&rsquo; Vice President of Audiology and Professional Services, has dedicated his life to hearing care. As a young man in college he was a pre-veterinary medicine major, and his love of animals led him to a hearing lab where scientists were studying the damage from noise exposure in chinchillas. There he found his calling. Since then Fabry has earned a doctorate in audiology from the University of Minnesota, published more than 50 articles and been a leader in the field for more than 30 years. However, he has never let go of his interest in noise exposure and raising awareness on how to prevent hearing loss. He has channeled this passion into our Listen Carefully campaign, and we sat down with him to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and solutions surrounding preventable hearing loss.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>How important is hearing protection?</strong></p>  <p>Hearing protection is critical for all age groups. Look at the history of OSHA and hearing protection in the workplace &ndash; we have done a very good job with occupational noise exposure in the workplace. However, recreational noise exposure has become an increasing problem for both adults and children, which could include anything from concerts to loud restaurants and bars to firearms.</p>  <p>We don&rsquo;t often think of children as being at risk for noise exposure, but in fact, it is a huge concern and an emerging problem in the United States with upwards of 20 percent of teens estimated to suffer from measurable hearing loss. We have to do better at protecting kids from preventable hearing loss.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Most of us have been told to wear hearing protection at concerts or to turn down the volume on our headphones to protect our hearing, but what are some of the lesser-known areas where hearing protection should be used?</strong></p>  <p>When looking at dangerous levels of noise exposure, it is all about the intensity of the sound and the duration of exposure. Any sound that is in excess of 85 dB, with extended exposure, will harm your hearing.</p>  <p>There are some really strange places that we don&rsquo;t often think of where dangerous levels of noise exposure can occur. Dentists, for example, are at high risk for noise exposure, due to the sound of the high-frequency drills they use daily. Likewise, the barista at your local coffee shop is at risk for noise exposure due to the sound of the grinder and the high-frequency sound of many cappuccino machines.</p>  <p>In terms of teenagers, one of the places we don&rsquo;t often think of is the school band. The students playing in those bands could be at risk for noise exposure, particularly percussionists and piccolo players and those positioned near them. Violinists are also at a high risk for hearing loss because as they play they place their ears directly against the instrument.</p>  <p>It is important for all of us to take active measures to protect against preventable hearing loss. In my own life I use noise-cancelling headphones on airplanes when I travel to protect against the sounds produced during take off and landing. I also use musicians earplugs when I go to concerts to reduce the sound across the entire frequency spectrum without impacting the sound of the music. I wear those same earplugs when I ride my motorcycle so I can adequately hear other motorists around me while also protecting my hearing. In addition, whenever I mow the grass, I wear hearing protection.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>What are the key issues surrounding noise exposure and iPods and MP3 players?</strong></p>  <p>A popular test of the volume of an iPod or MP3 player is that you should never allow the volume to go over half or two-thirds the maximum. Unfortunately, this is an oversimplification because with today&rsquo;s technology it is actually the headphones that determine the output level. I don&rsquo;t want parents and teens to be lulled into a false sense of security by keeping an iPod at or below half the maximum &ndash; that could still be a level that is damaging.</p>  <p>In addition, years ago, we used to recommend that if someone could stand three feet away from you and sing along with the song you are listening to, the music is too loud. But again, due to the level of technology available for headphones, this also no longer applies.</p>  <p>In an ideal world, we could measure on a simulated ear the level that someone listens to an iPod, and then set the limit, but this is not practical for real-world environments. I would encourage parents to listen to the iPod through your child&rsquo;s headphones, and then set the volume at a level that is comfortable for them and not uncomfortably loud. You can also download sound level meter apps that are pretty accurate. You can then hold your child&rsquo;s headphones up to the sound meter app to get an idea of the sound level and set the volume accordingly.</p>  <p>[gallery id=\"listen-carefully-gallery\"]</p>  <p><strong>How do you encourage your loved ones to protect their hearing?</strong></p>  <p>I am very particular with the level my daughter listens to music both in the car and on headphones. I always carry hearing protection with me when I go to concerts, so either my wife or my daughter will be encouraged to wear it when they are with me. I have always tried to stress the importance of protecting their hearing against recreational noise exposure.</p>",
