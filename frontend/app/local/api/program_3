    <h1>Hearing Aid Recycling</h1>

    <p>Every year thousands of hearing aids are donated to our Hear Now program from hearing professionals and other people looking to help. Those hearing aids open up the world of sound to someone in need. Many of the hearing aids used on international missions come from the recycling program, making hearing aid donations vital to the success of the Foundation. However, the journey from donation to the mission field is an absolute labor of love.&nbsp;</p>
