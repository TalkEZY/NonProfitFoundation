The Starkey team landed on the 23rd of May ready to work.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-Bringing_Peace_Through_Hearing-West_Bank-01.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:703px\" /></p>  <p>Crossing the border into the West Bank, they call it the Green Line, was a little intimidating. There was no record of us coming, but the Head of &nbsp;Sheba Medical said we are going in anyway, so we finally made it in. Once in the town of Tulkarm, there were hundreds of patients already waiting for us. We went to work.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-Bringing_Peace_Through_Hearing-West_Bank-02.jpg\" /></p>  <p>We have worked in Turkey, Egypt and Zanzibar all of which are Arabic influenced, so the core Starkey team was used to the culture of the Arabic ways, aggressive but also expressive&nbsp;and warm and always hugging and kissing!</p>  <p>The electricity in the front compound of the school was extreme. Israeli Jews working with and touching Palestinians! They could not even believe this was happening. Starkey Hearing Foundation brought shirts for everyone so we could be one team. It worked, you couldn&rsquo;t tell the Israeli&rsquo;s from the Palestinians from the Americans! We all looked the same and worked side-by-side bringing peace and understanding through hearing.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-Bringing_Peace_Through_Hearing-West_Bank-03.png\" style=\"height:525px; width:393px\" /></p>  <p>It is very important to the Palestinians that the Starkey Hearing Foundation stops and eat lunch, so we all sat, SHF, Israeli&rsquo;s, Palestinians, and Palestinian Military all sitting on elementary chairs eating lunch in this small classroom TOGETHER!!! It was something I cannot even describe, intense, polite, friendly and strange, I felt like it was a movie scene&hellip; Incredible!</p>  <p>Lots of better hearing smiles on all faces. Salah Hay Yihveh ,Physicians of Human Rights , said we made his heart open! That statement right there made my day. He was in charge of the project on the Palestinian side and did an extraordinary job on logistics.</p>  <p>It has been a moving experience, one that I will never forget.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-Bringing_Peace_Through_Hearing-West_Bank-04.png\" style=\"height:525px; width:838px\" /></p>",

        "text": "<p><strong>President George W. Bush Joins Us in Tanzania</strong></p>  <p>Starkey Hearing Foundation&rsquo;s weeklong mission in Tanzania started off with a bang! President George W. Bush personally joined the mission team in Dar es Salaam to help change the lives of people in need.</p>  <p>Donning one of the Foundation&rsquo;s blue polo shirts and a mission tool belt, President Bush took the time to shake hands with the volunteers before getting down to the business of fitting hearing aids. The former president was completely engaged&mdash;wanting to experience every step of the process, and after some training from Bill Austin, he put his glasses on and dove right into giving the gift of hearing.</p>  <p>President Bush was very involved in fitting a brother and sister. Once Austin explained to him the importance of vocalization for child development, particularly for children with new hearing aids, President Bush began to encourage the siblings to use their voices. As soon as the children started repeating sounds, the president hugged the parents and celebrated with them. We were honored to experience such hands-on support from the former president.</p>  <p>&ldquo;Hearing is a powerful gift that brings people together, opens doors and gives individuals the power to seize opportunities and reach their full potential in life,&rdquo; said Austin. &ldquo;President Bush has done amazing things across Africa in HIV/AIDS and cancer prevention and treatment, and we are incredibly grateful that he supports us in our fight for better hearing.&rdquo;</p>  <p>After completing missions in <a href=\"http://www.starkeyhearingfoundation.org/missions/africa/tanzania-07-2013/\">Tanzania </a>and <a href=\"http://www.starkeyhearingfoundation.org/missions/africa/malawi-07-2013/\">Malawi</a>, the mission team is back in Minneapolis for the So the World May Hear <a href=\"http://www.starkeyhearingfoundation.org/galas/\">Awards Gala</a>, before heading to Peru in August.</p>  <p><strong>The power of partnership</strong></p>  <p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-July_Newsletter_President_George_W_Bush_Joins_Us_in_Tanzania-01.jpg\" style=\"height:194px; width:320px\" /></strong></p>  <p>The rural and expansive nature of Honduras creates challenges when reaching out to those in need of hearing care. Fortunately, skilled and powerful partners, like Operation Honduras and Starkey Canada, make those challenges much less formidable.

Currently, we are nearly 40 percent ahead of schedule, fitting more than 165,000 hearing aids worldwide in the last year alone.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-August_Newsletter_President_Bill_Clinton_Continues_Support_for_Global_Fight_Against_Hearing_Loss-01.jpg\" style=\"height:223px; width:330px\" /></p>  <p>&ldquo;Starkey Hearing Foundation is empowering people around the world to achieve a better life through the gift of hearing,&rdquo; said President Clinton. &ldquo;Chelsea and I were honored, as we always are, to help the great Starkey staff fit people, many of whom had never heard before, for hearing aids.&rdquo;</p>  <p>President Clinton and Chelsea Clinton personally fitted patients with new hearing aids in both Zambia and Rwanda. President Clinton has spoken at Starkey&rsquo;s annual So the World May Hear Awards Gala for the last four years, including most recently on July 28, in St. Paul, Minn. This was his third time volunteering on a mission. He joined the Foundation in Colombia and Uganda in 2012.</p>  <p>Discussing the former president&rsquo;s dedication to the global fight against hearing loss, Bill Austin said, &ldquo;The support we received from President Clinton and the Clinton Global Initiative has enabled us to build vital partnerships and touch more lives than we ever thought possible.&rdquo;</p>  <p>Mission partners Global Health Corps and Bridge2Rwanda also worked with the team in Rwanda. Actors Jesse Eisenberg and Dakota Fanning joined us in Zambia. In between missions in Zambia and Rwanda, the mission team made an additional stop in <a href=\"http://www.starkeyhearingfoundation.org/missions/africa/tanzania-07-2013/\">Tanzania</a>, along with Tanzanian-born Hasheem Thabeet, of the NBA&rsquo;s Oklahoma City Thunder, to give the gift of hearing to more than 200 people in need.</p>  <p>The mission team is currently delivering the gift of hearing to nearly 10,000 patients in Peru.</p>  <p><strong>Building Sustainable Systems of Hearing Care</strong></p>  <p>To truly make an impact, our efforts must be sustainable. Our recent short film highlights our efforts in Rwanda and shows how, by working closely with on-the-ground partners, we bring patients long-term hearing care. The Rwanda program exemplifies how we incorporate a full-circle approach that ensures patients will be connected to the world of sound for years to come.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-August_Newsletter_President_Bill_Clinton_Continues_Support_for_Global_Fight_Against_Hearing_Loss-03.jpg\" style=\"height:185px; width:330px\" /></p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W50L7eNGT2U\">Watch our efforts to build sustainable systems of hearing care.</a></p>  <p><strong>Commit Today</strong></p>  <p>Thanks to your support,<a href=\"http://www.starkeyhearingfoundation.org/galas/\"> the 2013 So the World May Hear Awards Gala</a> set a new record!

        "text": "<p>For years, Chris and Kyle Massey have dedicated themselves to helping deliver the gift of hearing. From Vietnam to Mexico to Tanzania to our most recent mission in Peru, the Massey brothers are always up for an adventure that includes connecting people in need to the sounds of life. We sat down with them in Peru to discuss their long-standing support of the Foundation&rsquo;s work and what it means to their lives.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-One_on_One_With_The_Masseys-02.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:777px\" /></p>  <p><strong>How many missions have you been on?</strong></p>  <p><strong>Chris</strong>: Nine, including international and domestic missions. We plan on doing as many more as we can for the rest of our lives.</p>  <p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Absolutely!</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-One_on_One_With_The_Masseys-04.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:953px\" /></p>  <p><strong>What do you like about the people of Peru?</strong></p>  <p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Peru is an amazing place. The people here are so appreciative, and they are always so happy. It brings smiles to our faces to know that they really appreciate what we do. They are so genuine, and it makes it all worthwhile.</p>  <p><strong>Chris</strong>: Every day we share these cool moments with people. We might not ever see any of these people again, but we share these life-changing moments with them. If I ever do see any of them again in my life, we are going to know exactly who each other are because these moments shared through the gift of hearing are unforgettable.</p>  <p>I have had a few people I helped with their hearing aids find me on Twitter. They send me a tweet saying, &ldquo;Thank you for helping me with my hearing aids,&rdquo; and it is really cool to be able to stay connected and hear about their progress.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/DSC06887ccPeru-Day-15-Piura-Aug-26-Mon.jpg\" style=\"height:673px; width:1024px\" /></p>  <p><strong>What has been your favorite experience as a hearing mission volunteer in Peru?</strong></p>  <p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Being able to help a woman who is 108 years old. She is amazing! She heard about this mission and came down here to get her hearing aids. Bill Austin said, &ldquo;Even when you are 108, you don&rsquo;t want to be alone, and you want to be able to hear.&rdquo;</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-One_on_One_With_The_Masseys-03.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:796px\" /></p>  <p><strong>What do you guys like about being a part of the Starkey Hearing Foundation?</strong></p>  <p><strong>Chris</strong>: It is like a family, and I love being a part of it.</p>  <p><strong>Kyle</strong>: I think you need trips like this. Especially when you live in the craziness we live in. We live in Hollywood, and we see just the craziest stuff every day &ndash; people&rsquo;s priorities are often not the same as ours. Having the opportunity to know people who do not have much but are happy and smiling because of something as basic as the gift of hearing, it&rsquo;s refreshing. More people need to seek out experiences like this.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-One_on_One_With_The_Masseys-01.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:790px\" /></p>  <p><strong>Chris</strong>: We definitely want to get more young people involved in things like this. Some of the patients are older, but many of them are our age or younger. We helped one kid who was going to school for engineering, and he was about my age. He was embarrassed that he had to get a hearing aid, and we made him feel comfortable. He saw that we were here enjoying ourselves and laughing, and he realized that getting a hearing aid was not a big deal, and he shouldn&rsquo;t be embarrassed about. It was just life.</p>  <p>Spreading positivity to others is amazing.</p>",

The Foundation has partnered with Special Olympics Minnesota on its Healthy Hearing Athletes Initiative, and this mission kicked off what we hope will become a long and life-changing collaboration that will open up the world of sound to all Special Olympics athletes in need.

His mastery of piano, musical arrangements and soulful lyrics defy time and musical genre. Leon Russell is the definition of a musician&rsquo;s musician. However, after significant success in the 1960s and 70s, he mysteriously stepped away from the limelight.</p>  <p>While much of the world had forgotten about Russell&rsquo;s immense talent, John never did. In 2009, John decided to remind the world of the brilliance of his mentor and greatest influence by collaborating with Russell on a new album, &ldquo;The Union.&rdquo; Before the two piano men could begin to create what would become No. 3 on Rolling Stone magazine&rsquo;s list of the <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/30-best-albums-of-2010-20101213\">30 Best Albums of 2010</a>, John needed to help Russell address some significant health issues he had been living with, not the least of which was hearing loss.</p>  <p>Russell sufferers from hereditary nerve damage that causes hearing loss. Over the years, he slowly lost his connection to life. He struggled to understand conversations narrating the human interactions that had inspired him to create his music. During a recent visit to Starkey Hearing Foundation, Russell explained where he began to seek inspiration, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been much of a music listener. My hobby is silence.&rdquo;</p>  <p>A longtime supporter of Starkey Hearing Foundation, John put Russell in touch with Bill Austin as soon as he learned that he was struggling with hearing loss. Once Bill fit him with brand new state-of-the-art hearing aids, Russell went on to write John the song &ldquo;In the Hands of Angels,&rdquo; thanking him for bringing him back from the brink. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAkRohrypec&amp;feature=youtu.be\">When John first heard the song</a>, he was overcome with emotion, insisting that the song be a part of their album. With the help of his new hearing aids, Russell was able to perform this song and many others alongside John and continues to perform around the country with his band to this day.</p>  <p>Check out Leon Russell performing &ldquo;In the Hands of Angels&rdquo;:</p>  <p>[gallery id=\"blog-reawakening-the-master-film\"]</p>",

Branson and the Virgin Unite team worked closely with us to ensure each patient left the mission with a new connection to sound and life.</p>  <p>Discussing his continued dedication to the work of the Foundation, Branson said, &ldquo;I admire the Starkey Hearing Foundation for its tireless effort to transform lives with the gift of hearing. I hope it will inspire others, businesses and nonprofits alike, to seek new, innovative and entrepreneurial ways of making a difference in people&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;</p>  <p>Once the team wrapped up a successful mission in South Africa, we headed to our first mission in Lesotho with new partner Sentebale.</p>  <p>Prince Seeiso joined the team to help fit hearing aids and open up the world of sound to many living in silence and isolation. &ldquo;I have seen children wanting to talk to each other, and their eyes tell a thousand stories,&rdquo; Prince Seeiso said. &ldquo;On behalf of myself, Prince Harry and Sentebale, a big thanks goes to Starkey Hearing Foundation.&rdquo;</p>  <p>The team is currently in Kenya, where we have traveled from Mombasa to Eldoret to one of the largest slums in Africa, Kibera, to Meru, all the while reflecting caring and connecting communities with the gift of hearing.</p>  <p><strong>2013 Gala Highlights</strong></p>  <p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-October_Newsletter_A_Knight_and_a_Prince_Help_Kick_Off_Fall_Missions-03.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:939px\" /></strong></p>  <p>Whether it was the bald eagle soaring over the crowd as Nita Whitaker sang &ldquo;AmazingGrace,&rdquo; impassioned speeches from twin brothers Ashton and Michael Kutcher, or special surprise guests for Bill Austin, the 2013 So the World May Hear Awards Gala was an evening we will never forget.

        "text": "<p>Dave Fabry, Ph.D. audiologist and Starkey Hearing Technologies&rsquo; Vice President of Audiology and Professional Services, has dedicated his life to hearing care. As a young man in college he was a pre-veterinary medicine major, and his love of animals led him to a hearing lab where scientists were studying the damage from noise exposure in chinchillas. There he found his calling. Since then Fabry has earned a doctorate in audiology from the University of Minnesota, published more than 50 articles and been a leader in the field for more than 30 years. However, he has never let go of his interest in noise exposure and raising awareness on how to prevent hearing loss. He has channeled this passion into our Listen Carefully campaign, and we sat down with him to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and solutions surrounding preventable hearing loss.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-Dave_Fabry_Lives_to_Listen_Carefully-01.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:944px\" /></p>  <p><strong>How important is hearing protection?</strong></p>  <p>Hearing protection is critical for all age groups. Look at the history of OSHA and hearing protection in the workplace &ndash; we have done a very good job with occupational noise exposure in the workplace. However, recreational noise exposure has become an increasing problem for both adults and children, which could include anything from concerts to loud restaurants and bars to firearms.</p>  <p>We don&rsquo;t often think of children as being at risk for noise exposure, but in fact, it is a huge concern and an emerging problem in the United States with upwards of 20 percent of teens estimated to suffer from measurable hearing loss. We have to do better at protecting kids from preventable hearing loss.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-Dave_Fabry_Lives_to_Listen_Carefully-02.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:787px\" /></p>  <p><strong>Most of us have been told to wear hearing protection at concerts or to turn down the volume on our headphones to protect our hearing, but what are some of the lesser-known areas where hearing protection should be used?</strong></p>  <p>When looking at dangerous levels of noise exposure, it is all about the intensity of the sound and the duration of exposure. Any sound that is in excess of 85 dB, with extended exposure, will harm your hearing.</p>  <p>There are some really strange places that we don&rsquo;t often think of where dangerous levels of noise exposure can occur. Dentists, for example, are at high risk for noise exposure, due to the sound of the high-frequency drills they use daily. Likewise, the barista at your local coffee shop is at risk for noise exposure due to the sound of the grinder and the high-frequency sound of many cappuccino machines.</p>  <p>In terms of teenagers, one of the places we don&rsquo;t often think of is the school band. The students playing in those bands could be at risk for noise exposure, particularly percussionists and piccolo players and those positioned near them. Violinists are also at a high risk for hearing loss because as they play they place their ears directly against the instrument.</p>  <p>It is important for all of us to take active measures to protect against preventable hearing loss. In my own life I use noise-cancelling headphones on airplanes when I travel to protect against the sounds produced during take off and landing. I also use musicians earplugs when I go to concerts to reduce the sound across the entire frequency spectrum without impacting the sound of the music. I wear those same earplugs when I ride my motorcycle so I can adequately hear other motorists around me while also protecting my hearing. In addition, whenever I mow the grass, I wear hearing protection.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-Dave_Fabry_Lives_to_Listen_Carefully-03.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:700px\" /></p>  <p><strong>What are the key issues surrounding noise exposure and iPods and MP3 players?</strong></p>  <p>A popular test of the volume of an iPod or MP3 player is that you should never allow the volume to go over half or two-thirds the maximum. Unfortunately, this is an oversimplification because with today&rsquo;s technology it is actually the headphones that determine the output level. I don&rsquo;t want parents and teens to be lulled into a false sense of security by keeping an iPod at or below half the maximum &ndash; that could still be a level that is damaging.</p>  <p>In addition, years ago, we used to recommend that if someone could stand three feet away from you and sing along with the song you are listening to, the music is too loud. But again, due to the level of technology available for headphones, this also no longer applies.</p>  <p>In an ideal world, we could measure on a simulated ear the level that someone listens to an iPod, and then set the limit, but this is not practical for real-world environments. I would encourage parents to listen to the iPod through your child&rsquo;s headphones, and then set the volume at a level that is comfortable for them and not uncomfortably loud. You can also download sound level meter apps that are pretty accurate. You can then hold your child&rsquo;s headphones up to the sound meter app to get an idea of the sound level and set the volume accordingly.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-Dave_Fabry_Lives_to_Listen_Carefully-04.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:815px\" /></p>  <p><strong>How do you encourage your loved ones to protect their hearing?</strong></p>  <p>I am very particular with the level my daughter listens to music both in the car and on headphones. I always carry hearing protection with me when I go to concerts, so either my wife or my daughter will be encouraged to wear it when they are with me. I have always tried to stress the importance of protecting their hearing against recreational noise exposure.</p>",

Traveling from nearby Metro Deaf School and Faribault School for the Deaf, and from as far away as California, Missouri and Indiana, more than 50 patients arrived at our headquarters for a hearing mission with the <a href=\"http://www.starkeyhearingfoundation.org/missions/usa/us-minnesota-10-2013/\">Minnesota Vikings </a>and Starkey Hearing Technologies. Overjoyed to meet their heroes, the children taught Vikings stars Adrian Peterson, Greg Jennings, Josh Freeman, Jerome Simpson and Greg Childs some sign language, while the players doled out encouragement, inspiration and autographs.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-November_Newsletter_Minnesota_Vikings_partner_for_homegrown_hearing_mission-01.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:804px\" /></p>  <p>Peterson and Jennings laughed and joked with the children, and each of the players had the opportunity to assist as we fit each patient with brand new top-of-the-line hearing aids, customized to their hearing loss.</p>  <p>Thanks to Starkey Hearing Technologies, the Vikings and these players with generous hearts, each child left with a huge smile and had a day they will never forget.</p>  <p><strong>Happy Thanksgiving!</strong></p>  <p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-November_Newsletter_Minnesota_Vikings_partner_for_homegrown_hearing_mission-02.jpg\" style=\"height:216px; width:300px\" /></strong></p>  <p>The team just finished giving the gift of hearing during our first visit to Cambodia.

Her aptitude for sports has led her to swimming, golf, bocce ball, track and field and bowling, and it has also garnered the attention of sports stars like Tiger Woods and Matt Blair. Her mother and coach Pat expressed great pride in her daughter saying, &ldquo;The minimum age for participating in the Special Olympics is eight, and Katie just counted down the days until her eighth birthday when she could become a part of this incredible organization.&rdquo;</p>  <p>However, Katie&rsquo;s path to success has not been without some extraordinary challenges caused by hearing loss. Due to Katie&rsquo;s high pain tolerance, as a child she suffered many ear infections that went undetected. In addition, her love of swimming created issues with swimmer&rsquo;s ear and a recurring need for tubes in her ears. After several surgeries, Katie and her family had resigned themselves to the fact that her right ear could be treated with a hearing aid, but she would never hear out of her left ear again. Katie learned to adapt, but her mother always felt that if she could only have the use of both of her ears, she wouldn&rsquo;t have to struggle so much to excel.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-Powering_inspiration_in_eden_prairie-01.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:814px\" /></p>  <p>At our recent Special Olympics mission in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, Bill Austin gave Katie the gift of hearing in BOTH of her ears.

        "text": "<p><strong>Caring for Our Friends in the Philippines</strong></p>  <p>Over 35 days, four countries and 10 cities, the hearing mission team finished the year strong, fitting more than 12,000 people. Crisscrossing Asia, we brought the gift of hearing to India, Cambodia, China and completed our tour with an impactful, four-city hearing mission in the Philippines.</p>  <p>Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines three weeks before our long-scheduled hearing mission was set to take place. For a second after that tragedy, we paused to consider how to help, and we decided that the best thing we could do was go, as planned, to give the gift of hearing. Joined by boxing champion Manny Pacquiao, fresh from his victory in China, and singer Jessica Sanchez, we brought our love and care to more than 5,000 people in need.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-December_newsletter_caring_for_our_friends_in_the_Philippines-01.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:697px\" /></p>  <p>In his hometown of General Santos, Pacquiao proudly joined the hearing mission team to give back to his local community. He fulfilled two wishes for one young man who got to meet both his hero and receive the gift of hearing.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-December_newsletter_caring_for_our_friends_in_the_Philippines-02.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:774px\" /></p>  <p>Excited to be as hands-on as possible with the patients, Sanchez worked and traveled with the team for the entire hearing mission. Her first day on the job she helped reconnect 88-year-old Maria Solis Sogon with her 12 children, 20 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. Overwhelmed with gratitude, Maria broke into song to Sanchez&rsquo;s delight. By the end of the hearing mission, it was Sanchez who was moved to song by all of the incredible people and lives she was able to help change. She performed for a captivated audience, giving many of them their first experience of music.</p>  <p>From General Santos to Lipa City to Batangas to Manila, the team was inspired by the resilience of the Philippines. While many may have been knocked down by the impact of Typhoon Haiyan, from what we experienced, their spirit has not been broken. It will not take long for the Philippines to be just as strong, if not stronger than it was before.</p>  <p><strong>Happy Holidays!</strong></p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-December_newsletter_caring_for_our_friends_in_the_Philippines-03.jpg\" style=\"height:234px; width:300px\" /></p>  <p>With the holidays upon us, the team is busy preparing for another year of changing lives, while also spending some quality time with the people we love.

        "text": "<p>Sunday April 17, 2011: It&#39;s been a very busy week for the Foundation in the media world (USA Today, \"The Celebrity Apprentice\" and Gary Busey on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" &amp; \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\") PLUS being on the road! Once again our sponsors could not go with us so we asked a few employees to go along. Todd Hedberg, whom I had never met and Derek Johnson from Customer Service, both bilingual. Mucho mucho bueno! Big Big Help! Along with Fred, Rachael, Mark, Justin and Rene, Bill took off for Mexico with just two hours in between flights in Minneapolis.</p>  <p>The team met up with more Starkey employees in Brownsville, Texas headed by Starkey Mexico manager, Dora Ayala and her team. Beautifully organized missions in partnership with the Lions Club chapter in Matamoras, Monterrey and San Luis Potisi. Thousands received the gift of hearing with many beautiful stories and tears of joy. No better story than the ending day in San Luis Potisi, when we were packing up to catch the plane to Colombia when Rene asked Bill if we could fit two young men that had walked up even though we were almost packed up. Bill never ever hesitates to say yes even though this will put time stress on us.</p>  <p>Amazingly these young men were begging on the side of the road when this woman stopped to see what they needed (even though it is extremely dangerous time in Mexico and was absolutely NOT the thing to do). Turns out the two were deaf and the woman had heard about the Lions Club/SHF Better Hearing Mission on the radio. She told them to get in the car and drive to her friend&rsquo;s house whose husband is with the Lion&#39;s Club. Her friend called her husband at work to ask where the mission was being held, he told her where and they rushed right over to the mission site just barely catching us. Both young men had no speech, one takes two 70 gain aids and the other takes two 50 gain aids, neither one of them can believe this is happening. It was a leap of faith by all parties and the message that there is so much good left in the world!</p>  <p>Onto Colombia, where the Starkey staff is waiting at the airport and we see the smiling face of Catalina Parra, manager of Starkey Colombia, as we walk out of customs. All throughout the airport the Colombian workers were thanking us for helping the children so we knew right away Catalina had spread the word (this rarely happens in customs!). The Colombian people are so very gracious and gave us many, many blessings and celebrations. We have been in Cali and Cartegna working with four of our customers along with Starkey Colombia Team.</p>  <p>Always smiles and blessings! We work at the University tomorrow and finish up the run delivering over 5,000 hearing aids to some very deserving and gracious people. They say over and over \"God Bless you\" and we always say \"He does!\"</p>  <p>Thank You to ALL the Starkey Team that makes this happen!</p>  <p><br /> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://starkey.local/uploads/files/BLOG-_Tani_Austins_inspiring_words-_Mexico_and_Colombia-_01.png\" style=\"height:525px; width:767px\" /></p>",

Skye works with our country coordinators and partners across Africa, Asia and South America to ensure that when the patients come to us for help, we are more than ready to meet their needs. We sat down with Skye to learn more about what it takes to prepare for phase two of a hearing mission, when we fit patients with hearing aids and give the gift of hearing.</p>  <p><strong>What are the key things you need to do to prepare for a phase two hearing mission?</strong></p>  <p>I need to inform our partners and keep in close contact with them to ensure that everything we need is ready. This means making sure we have exact dates, a site, tents, chairs, tables, volunteers. I also need to know any national or cultural events or holidays during our scheduled hearing mission. We need to take into account any changes in political climate or weather. I need to make sure our partners and coordinators in the field are going through their checklists over and over again to ensure everything is ready. Basically, a lot of emails, texts, phone calls, hope and crossed-fingers.</p>  <p>[gallery id=\"blog-preparing-to-give-the-gift-of-hearing\"]</p>  <p><strong>What are the biggest challenges you face in preparing for a hearing mission?</strong></p>  <p>Trusting that the prices and everything that has been negotiated follows through and that all of the legwork has been done is a huge challenge. Because we manage much of the preparation remotely, it is difficult to ensure that what needs to happen does happen. Therefore, we rely heavily on our country coordinators and our partners to follow through. We are only as good as our partners.</p>  <p><strong>What are your favorite things to do in preparation?</strong></p>  <p>We focus strongly on the development of AfterCare programs. Throughout the process, we have ongoing conversations with our coordinators and partners about AfterCare strategies for after we leave. Much of the strategy and planning for this happens during preparation, but the hardcore training happens when we are there on the ground in order to enable our partners to take the program and run with it. It is exciting to be a part of their success.</p>  <p>The other incredible thing is discovering great stories behind the hearing mission experience. There are always people we fit that have these amazing stories, and if we can find them ahead of time, then we can capture their story to share in the best way possible.</p>  <p><strong>What do you take advantage of when you are home that you miss when you are on a hearing mission?</strong></p>  <p>At home, I love not having to check in and out of a hotel and being able to just leave my stuff where I want. I love getting in my car and being able take myself somewhere. It&rsquo;s all the most basic things! To me Trader Joe&rsquo;s, some hot yoga and a shopping trip to REI &hellip;. I love it.</p>  <p><strong>What do you look forward to most in the hearing mission experience?</strong></p>  <p>I love setup day. Of course the hearing mission days are great, but all the planning culminates on set-up day &ndash; the day before the hearing mission. During this time we are training all of our volunteers, watching the tents go up and the chairs being set up. I want to make sure it&rsquo;s perfect. Then on the hearing mission day, I can enjoy giving the gift of hearing, knowing that all of the energy that went into the preparation was well worth it.</p>",

Thanks to God!&rdquo;</p>  <p>His unbridled joy brought him to his feet in dance, as he immediately began to relish in all the sounds of life.</p>  <p>[gallery id=\"blog-giving-back-the-world-in-trujillo-film\"]</p>",

        "text": "<p>Like a typical 9-year-old girl, Maci Rowan loves the band One Direction and will proudly proclaim to anyone listening that her favorite song is&nbsp;What Makes You Beautiful. However, Maci is anything but typical. Born with cerebral palsy, she has had to overcome some significant physical obstacles in her short life. These obstacles became even more daunting last year when she began to suffer hearing loss.</p>  <p>Despite her hearing loss, Maci continued to seek out ways to connect to the world and outlets for her jubilant energy and desire to learn. Unfortunately, Maci&rsquo;s normally excellent grades began to fall, and her frustration with not doing well in school and inability to connect with her peers and teachers, caused her to act out in class.&nbsp; At home, she turned to her dolls for company and connection. Her mother Christy became increasingly concerned over Maci&rsquo;s retreat into isolation. She recognized that hearing loss was to blame and reached out to Starkey Hearing Foundation for help.</p>  <p>[gallery id=\"an-u\"]</p>  <p>[gallery id=\"blog-an-unstoppable-spirit-02\"]</p>  <p>When Maci came to see us in New Orleans, her smile lit up the room, and her laughter was contagious. We had invited Maci to our Friday mission in partnership with Garth Brooks&rsquo; Super ProCamps, so that she could not only receive the gift of hearing but also participate in all the fun activities for the children. We watched in amazement as NFL stars were drawn to her boundless joy and curiosity. The Foundation team and our celebrity volunteers just couldn&rsquo;t get enough of Maci. &nbsp;Explaining her daughter&rsquo;s unique spirit, Christy said with a smile, &ldquo;She has always been this way. Once she gets you wrapped around her finger, you&rsquo;re lost. You have no chance of disciplining her.&rdquo;</p>  <p>By the time she sat in Bill Austin&rsquo;s chair to receive the gift of hearing, Maci had not heard her own voice in months, but once she was fit, she beamed her irrepressible light and cried out, &ldquo;Oh! I can talk again!&rdquo;</p>  <p>Able to confidently connect with the world again, Maci immediately joined the kids participating in the ProCamps cheerleading activities and won the &ldquo;Champion of the Day&rdquo; award. We know that with the gift of hearing this amazing girl will continue winning and inspire many more hearts and minds.</p>",
