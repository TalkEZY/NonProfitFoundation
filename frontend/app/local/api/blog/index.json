      "title": "Tani Austinâ€™s inspiring words on her journey through Mexico and Colombia",
      "text": "<p>Sunday April 17, 2011: It&#39;s been a very busy week for the Foundation in the media world (USA Today, \"The Celebrity Apprentice\" and Gary Busey on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" &amp; \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\") PLUS being on the road! Once again our sponsors could not go with us so we asked a few employees to go along. Todd Hedberg, whom I had never met and Derek Johnson from Customer Service, both bilingual. Mucho mucho bueno! Big Big Help! Along with Fred, Rachael, Mark, Justin and Rene, Bill took off for Mexico with just two hours in between flights in Minneapolis.</p>  <p>The team met up with more Starkey employees in Brownsville, Texas headed by Starkey Mexico manager, Dora Ayala and her team. Beautifully organized missions in partnership with the Lions Club chapter in Matamoras, Monterrey and San Luis Potisi. Thousands received the gift of hearing with many beautiful stories and tears of joy. No better story than the ending day in San Luis Potisi, when we were packing up to catch the plane to Colombia when Rene asked Bill if we could fit two young men that had walked up even though we were almost packed up. Bill never ever hesitates to say yes even though this will put time stress on us.</p>  <p>Amazingly these young men were begging on the side of the road when this woman stopped to see what they needed (even though it is extremely dangerous time in Mexico and was absolutely NOT the thing to do). Turns out the two were deaf and the woman had heard about the Lions Club/SHF Better Hearing Mission on the radio. She told them to get in the car and drive to her friend&rsquo;s house whose husband is with the Lion&#39;s Club. Her friend called her husband at work to ask where the mission was being held, he told her where and they rushed right over to the mission site just barely catching us. Both young men had no speech, one takes two 70 gain aids and the other takes two 50 gain aids, neither one of them can believe this is happening. It was a leap of faith by all parties and the message that there is so much good left in the world!</p>  <p>Onto Colombia, where the Starkey staff is waiting at the airport and we see the smiling face of Catalina Parra, manager of Starkey Colombia, as we walk out of customs. All throughout the airport the Colombian workers were thanking us for helping the children so we knew right away Catalina had spread the word (this rarely happens in customs!). The Colombian people are so very gracious and gave us many, many blessings and celebrations. We have been in Cali and Cartegna working with four of our customers along with Starkey Colombia Team.</p>  <p>Always smiles and blessings! We work at the University tomorrow and finish up the run delivering over 5,000 hearing aids to some very deserving and gracious people. They say over and over \"God Bless you\" and we always say \"He does!\"</p>  <p>Thank You to ALL the Starkey Team that makes this happen!</p>",

      "text": "<p>International Hearing Mission Liaison Skye Girardin crisscrosses the globe dozens of times each year working to build solid partnerships that help us develop sustainable systems of hearing care. Skye works with our country coordinators and partners across Africa, Asia and South America to ensure that when the patients come to us for help, we are more than ready to meet their needs. We sat down with Skye to learn more about what it takes to prepare for phase two of a hearing mission, when we fit patients with hearing aids and give the gift of hearing.</p>  <p><strong>What are the key things you need to do to prepare for a phase two hearing mission?</strong></p>  <p>I need to inform our partners and keep in close contact with them to ensure that everything we need is ready. This means making sure we have exact dates, a site, tents, chairs, tables, volunteers. I also need to know any national or cultural events or holidays during our scheduled hearing mission. We need to take into account any changes in political climate or weather. I need to make sure our partners and coordinators in the field are going through their checklists over and over again to ensure everything is ready. Basically, a lot of emails, texts, phone calls, hope and crossed-fingers.</p>  <p>[gallery id = \"blog-preparing-to-give-the-gift-of-hearing\"]</p>  <p><strong>What are the biggest challenges you face in preparing for a hearing mission?</strong></p>  <p>Trusting that the prices and everything that has been negotiated follows through and that all of the legwork has been done is a huge challenge. Because we manage much of the preparation remotely, it is difficult to ensure that what needs to happen does happen. Therefore, we rely heavily on our country coordinators and our partners to follow through. We are only as good as our partners.</p>  <p><strong>What are your favorite things to do in preparation?</strong></p>  <p>We focus strongly on the development of AfterCare programs. Throughout the process, we have ongoing conversations with our coordinators and partners about AfterCare strategies for after we leave. Much of the strategy and planning for this happens during preparation, but the hardcore training happens when we are there on the ground in order to enable our partners to take the program and run with it. It is exciting to be a part of their success.</p>  <p>The other incredible thing is discovering great stories behind the hearing mission experience. There are always people we fit that have these amazing stories, and if we can find them ahead of time, then we can capture their story to share in the best way possible.</p>  <p><strong>What do you take advantage of when you are home that you miss when you are on a hearing mission?</strong></p>  <p>At home, I love not having to check in and out of a hotel and being able to just leave my stuff where I want. I love getting in my car and being able take myself somewhere. It&rsquo;s all the most basic things! To me Trader Joe&rsquo;s, some hot yoga and a shopping trip to REI &hellip;. I love it.</p>  <p><strong>What do you look forward to most in the hearing mission experience?</strong></p>  <p>I love setup day. Of course the hearing mission days are great, but all the planning culminates on set-up day &ndash; the day before the hearing mission. During this time we are training all of our volunteers, watching the tents go up and the chairs being set up. I want to make sure it&rsquo;s perfect. Then on the hearing mission day, I can enjoy giving the gift of hearing, knowing that all of the energy that went into the preparation was well worth it.</p>",

However, Maci is anything but typical. Born with cerebral palsy, she has had to overcome some significant physical obstacles in her short life. These obstacles became even more daunting last year when she began to suffer hearing loss.</p>  <p>Despite her hearing loss, Maci continued to seek out ways to connect to the world and outlets for her jubilant energy and desire to learn. Unfortunately, Maci&rsquo;s normally excellent grades began to fall, and her frustration with not doing well in school and inability to connect with her peers and teachers, caused her to act out in class.&nbsp; At home, she turned to her dolls for company and connection. Her mother Christy became increasingly concerned over Maci&rsquo;s retreat into isolation. She recognized that hearing loss was to blame and reached out to Starkey Hearing Foundation for help.</p>  <p>[gallery id = \"an-u\"]</p>  <p>When Maci came to see us in New Orleans, her smile lit up the room, and her laughter was contagious. We had invited Maci to our Friday mission in partnership with Garth Brooks&rsquo; Super ProCamps, so that she could not only receive the gift of hearing but also participate in all the fun activities for the children. We watched in amazement as NFL stars were drawn to her boundless joy and curiosity. The Foundation team and our celebrity volunteers just couldn&rsquo;t get enough of Maci. &nbsp;Explaining her daughter&rsquo;s unique spirit, Christy said with a smile, &ldquo;She has always been this way. Once she gets you wrapped around her finger, you&rsquo;re lost. You have no chance of disciplining her.&rdquo;</p>  <p>By the time she sat in Bill Austin&rsquo;s chair to receive the gift of hearing, Maci had not heard her own voice in months, but once she was fit, she beamed her irrepressible light and cried out, &ldquo;Oh! I can talk again!&rdquo;</p>  <p>Able to confidently connect with the world again, Maci immediately joined the kids participating in the ProCamps cheerleading activities and won the &ldquo;Champion of the Day&rdquo; award. We know that with the gift of hearing this amazing girl will continue winning and inspire many more hearts and minds.</p>",
