    "text": "<p>Starkey Hearing Foundation&nbsp;is excited to be heading back to the West Bank soon for an upcoming hearing mission. Our work in the region has shown us how hearing brings people together and serves as a vehicle for peace and understanding.</p>  <p>We wanted to share some feedback from a recent mission as we currently prepare for the next one.</p>  <p>&ldquo;Before the mission &ndash; my first &ndash; I was so excited and really didn&rsquo;t know what to expect. Now I can definitely&nbsp;say it was not like anything I had done before. I have lived in this conflict all my life, and today, for the first time I met my neighbors who greeted me with nothing but love. I was amazed to see all the happy faces and know that my small efforts could give someone so much joy. I hope that this mission will take us one step closer to peace, and I hope it won&rsquo;t be the last.&rdquo;</p>  <p>- Chen Cohen</p>  <p>Our local partners have been hard at work, completing phase one by identifying patients and taking impressions. We look forward to contributing to peace building by continuing to foster connections between people and across cultures through the gift of hearing.

It was our first hearing mission in the country where we had another wonderful partner in <a href=\"http://sentebale.org/\" title=\"\">Sentebale</a>, a nonprofit organization co-founded by Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, who participated in the fittings. Patients, ranging from 4 to 101 years old, traveled from all parts of the small, landlocked country to have their hearing assessed and be fitted for hearing aids. For many it was an opportunity to hear for the very first time.</p>  <p>&nbsp; After being honored at the 13th Annual Starkey Hearing Foundation&rsquo;s <em>So the World May Hear Awards</em>Gala in July, Branson joined us to bring the gift of hearing to Virgin Unite&rsquo;s Bhubezi Healthcare Clinic. More than 300 patients from the surrounding Bushbruckridge community were fit with hearing aids. Branson and the Virgin Unite team worked closely with us to ensure each patient left the mission with a new connection to sound and life.</p>  <p>&nbsp; Discussing his continued dedication to the work of the Foundation, Branson said, &ldquo;I admire the Starkey Hearing Foundation for its tireless effort to transform lives with the gift of hearing. I hope it will inspire others, businesses and nonprofits alike, to seek new, innovative and entrepreneurial ways of making a difference in people&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;</p>  <p>&nbsp; Once the team wrapped up a successful mission in South Africa, we headed to our first mission in Lesotho with new partner <a href=\"http://sentebale.com\">Sentebale</a>.</p>  <p>&nbsp; Prince Seeiso joined the team to help fit hearing aids and open up the world of sound to many living in silence and isolation. &ldquo;I have seen children wanting to talk to each other, and their eyes tell a thousand stories,&rdquo; Prince Seeiso said. &ldquo;On behalf of myself, Prince Harry and Sentebale, a big thanks goes to Starkey Hearing Foundation.&rdquo;</p>  <p>&nbsp; The team is currently in Kenya, where we have traveled from Mombasa to Eldoret to one of the largest slums in Africa, Kibera, to Meru, all the while reflecting caring and connecting communities with the gift of hearing.</p>  <p>&nbsp; <strong>2013 Gala Highlights</strong></p>  <p>&nbsp; Whether it was the bald eagle soaring over the crowd as Nita Whitaker sang &ldquo;AmazingGrace,&rdquo; impassioned speeches from twin brothers Ashton and Michael Kutcher, or special surprise guests for Bill Austin, the 2013 <em>So the World May Hear</em> Awards Gala was an evening we will never forget.

    "title": "Dave Fabry Lives to Listen Carefully",
    "text": "<p>Dave Fabry, Ph.D. audiologist and Starkey Hearing Technologies’ Vice President of Audiology and Professional Services, has dedicated his life to hearing care. As a young man in college he was a pre-veterinary medicine major, and his love of animals led him to a hearing lab where scientists were studying the damage from noise exposure in chinchillas. There he found his calling. Since then Fabry has earned a doctorate in audiology from the University of Minnesota, published more than 50 articles and been a leader in the field for more than 30 years. However, he has never let go of his interest in noise exposure and raising awareness on how to prevent hearing loss. He has channeled this passion into our Listen Carefully campaign, and we sat down with him to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and solutions surrounding preventable hearing loss.</p>  <p>&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.starkeyhearingfoundation.org/blog/dave-fabry-lives-to-listen-carefully/screen-shot-2013-09-30-at-9-06-05-am-2/\" title=\"\"></a></p>  <p>&nbsp; <b>How important is hearing protection?</b></p>  <p>&nbsp; Hearing protection is critical for all age groups. Look at the history of OSHA and hearing protection in the workplace – we have done a very good job with occupational noise exposure in the workplace. However, recreational noise exposure has become an increasing problem for both adults and children, which could include anything from concerts to loud restaurants and bars to firearms.</p>  <p>&nbsp; We don’t often think of children as being at risk for noise exposure, but in fact, it is a huge concern and an emerging problem in the United States with upwards of 20 percent of teens estimated to suffer from measurable hearing loss. We have to do better at protecting kids from preventable hearing loss.</p>  <p>&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.starkeyhearingfoundation.org/blog/dave-fabry-lives-to-listen-carefully/img_5019/\" title=\"\"></a></p>  <p>&nbsp; <b>Most of us have been told to wear hearing protection at concerts or to turn down the volume on our headphones to protect our hearing, but what are some of the lesser-known areas where hearing protection should be used?</b></p>  <p>&nbsp; When looking at dangerous levels of noise exposure, it is all about the intensity of the sound and the duration of exposure. Any sound that is in excess of 85 dB, with extended exposure, will harm your hearing.</p>  <p>&nbsp; There are some really strange places that we don’t often think of where dangerous levels of noise exposure can occur. Dentists, for example, are at high risk for noise exposure, due to the sound of the high-frequency drills they use daily. Likewise, the barista at your local coffee shop is at risk for noise exposure due to the sound of the grinder and the high-frequency sound of many cappuccino machines.</p>  <p>&nbsp; In terms of teenagers, one of the places we don’t often think of is the school band. The students playing in those bands could be at risk for noise exposure, particularly percussionists and piccolo players and those positioned near them. Violinists are also at a high risk for hearing loss because as they play they place their ears directly against the instrument.</p>  <p>&nbsp; It is important for all of us to take active measures to protect against preventable hearing loss. In my own life I use noise-cancelling headphones on airplanes when I travel to protect against the sounds produced during take off and landing. I also use musicians earplugs when I go to concerts to reduce the sound across the entire frequency spectrum without impacting the sound of the music. I wear those same earplugs when I ride my motorcycle so I can adequately hear other motorists around me while also protecting my hearing. In addition, whenever I mow the grass, I wear hearing protection.</p>  <p>&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.starkeyhearingfoundation.org/blog/dave-fabry-lives-to-listen-carefully/socm2639-00-ee-hf-listen-carefully-facts-facebook-1/\" title=\"\"></a></p>  <p>&nbsp; <b>What are the key issues surrounding noise exposure and iPods and MP3 players?</b></p>  <p>&nbsp; A popular test of the volume of an iPod or MP3 player is that you should never allow the volume to go over half or two-thirds the maximum. Unfortunately, this is an oversimplification because with today’s technology it is actually the headphones that determine the output level. I don’t want parents and teens to be lulled into a false sense of security by keeping an iPod at or below half the maximum – that could still be a level that is damaging.</p>  <p>&nbsp; In addition, years ago, we used to recommend that if someone could stand three feet away from you and sing along with the song you are listening to, the music is too loud. But again, due to the level of technology available for headphones, this also no longer applies.</p>  <p>&nbsp; In an ideal world, we could measure on a simulated ear the level that someone listens to an iPod, and then set the limit, but this is not practical for real-world environments. I would encourage parents to listen to the iPod through your child’s headphones, and then set the volume at a level that is comfortable for them and not uncomfortably loud. You can also download sound level meter apps that are pretty accurate. You can then hold your child’s headphones up to the sound meter app to get an idea of the sound level and set the volume accordingly.</p>  <p>&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.starkeyhearingfoundation.org/blog/dave-fabry-lives-to-listen-carefully/dsc01235cc3/\" title=\"\"></a></p>  <p>&nbsp; <b>How do you encourage your loved ones to protect their hearing?</b></p>  <p>&nbsp; </p>  <p>&nbsp; I am very particular with the level my daughter listens to music both in the car and on headphones. I always carry hearing protection with me when I go to concerts, so either my wife or my daughter will be encouraged to wear it when they are with me. I have always tried to stress the importance of protecting their hearing against recreational noise exposure.</p>",

    "title": "December Newsletter: Caring for Our Friends in the Philippines",
    "text": "<p><b>Caring for Our Friends in the Philippines</b></p>  <p>&nbsp; Over 35 days, four countries and 10 cities, the hearing mission team finished the year strong, fitting more than 12,000 people. Crisscrossing Asia, we brought the gift of hearing to India, Cambodia, China and completed our tour with an impactful, four-city hearing mission in the Philippines.</p>  <p>&nbsp; </p>  <p>&nbsp; Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines three weeks before our long-scheduled hearing mission was set to take place. For a second after that tragedy, we paused to consider how to help, and we decided that the best thing we could do was go, as planned, to give the gift of hearing. Joined by boxing champion Manny Pacquiao, fresh from his victory in China, and singer Jessica Sanchez, we brought our love and care to more than 5,000 people in need.</p>  <p>&nbsp; Excited to be as hands-on as possible with the patients, Sanchez worked and traveled with the team for the entire hearing mission. Her first day on the job she helped reconnect 88-year-old Maria Solis Sogon with her 12 children, 20 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. Overwhelmed with gratitude, Maria broke into song to Sanchez’s delight. By the end of the hearing mission, it was Sanchez who was moved to song by all of the incredible people and lives she was able to help change. She performed for a captivated audience, giving many of them their first experience of music.</p>  <p>&nbsp; From General Santos to Lipa City to Batangas to Manila, the team was inspired by the resilience of the Philippines. While many may have been knocked down by the impact of Typhoon Haiyan, from what we experienced, their spirit has not been broken. It will not take long for the Philippines to be just as strong, if not stronger than it was before.</p>  <p>&nbsp; </p>  <p>&nbsp; <b>Happy Holidays!</b></p>  <p>&nbsp; With the holidays upon us, the team is busy preparing for another year of changing lives, while also spending some quality time with the people we love. From the Starkey Hearing Foundation family to yours, we wish you all love, light and peace this holiday season. Thank you for all you do to support our efforts around the world. May 2014 bring you inspiration and adventure!</p>  <p>&nbsp; As you spend time with your friends and families this holiday season, remember the connecting power of hearing.</p>  <p>&nbsp; </p>  <p>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://action.starkeyhearingfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Pledge your support</a> today and help us give that same connection to thousands of families around the world in 2014.</p>",
